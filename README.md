# 77-Million-Stories
An experiment in narrative art

Introducing StoryLinks, NFTs as narration primitives.
Their power lies in composability.
One can combine them with existing avatars or artworks to give them a life story.
They can be used by any project and platform, opening a wide range of story weaving possibilities. 

The NFTS are generated by a P5.JS sketch integrated with Highlight generative art tools.
They are minted on Shape L2 mainnet.
