# 77-Million-Stories
An experiment in narrative art

Introducing StoryLinks, NFTs as narration primitives.
Their power lies in composability.
One can combine them with existing avatars or artworks to give them a life story.
They can be used by any project and platform, opening a wide range of story weaving possibilities. 

The NFTS are generated by a P5.JS sketch integrated with Highlight generative art tools.
They are minted on Shape L2 mainnet.

Platforms can use the metadata under the form and presentation that suits them best simply by calling NFTs with the contract address. 
The avatar can then be combined with the Storylinks present in the same wallet. 

In V1 Storylinks users can equip and unequip storylinks by transferring nfts between wallets or putting them on the second market. 
In V2 an ad hoc smart contract can enable more granular choices and ease of use.

Specific storylinks collections could be done also in collaboration with other projects. 

Many developments are possible on this foundation, which can turn 77 Million Stories into a narration hub for the Shape L2 ecosystem.
